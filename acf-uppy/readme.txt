Uppy Field for Advanced Custom Fields

== Description ==

__ACF Uppy Field__ is a WordPress plugin that adds a new `Uppy` custom field to the list of fields of the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com) plugin. This custom field allows you to __upload files of all types and sizes__ using the [TUS protocol](https://tus.io) and the [Uppy JS uploader](https://uppy.io), overcoming the limitations of the default ACF `File` field. With __ACF Uppy Field__, you no longer need to increase server-side INI parameters such as `upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`, `max_execution_time` and `memory_limit`.
